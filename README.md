# Scheduler

## Description

A simple calendar that can be used to keep track of events for the current day. Displays the common working hours of 9 am to 5 am. Each hour is color coded to represent whether it's in the past and it's events have already happened, it is current and the events are happening, or it is in the future, and events will happen.

You can input text into each hour and use the button on the right to save that event for that hour. Events will not repeat on the next day automatically.
